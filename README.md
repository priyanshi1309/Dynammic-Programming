# Dynamic Programming in C#

Welcome to the **Dynamic Programming (DP) in C#** repository!  
This project is a collection of classic and advanced dynamic programming problems solved using C#. It is intended as a reference and learning resource for understanding DP techniques and patterns.

## üß† What is Dynamic Programming?

Dynamic Programming is an optimization technique used to solve complex problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems and storing the results of subproblems to avoid redundant computations.

This repository covers:
- Recursion to DP transitions
- Memoization (Top-down approach)
- Tabulation (Bottom-up approach)
- Space optimization
- 1D, 2D, and multidimensional DP problems

## üß© Topics Covered

- Fibonacci Sequence
- 0/1 Knapsack
- Unbounded Knapsack
- Longest Common Subsequence (LCS)
- Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS)
- Matrix Path Problems
- Coin Change (min/max coins)
- Subset Sum / Partition
- Palindromic Substrings
- Edit Distance
- DP on Trees
- DP on Grids
- Bitmask DP (Advanced)
- and more...
